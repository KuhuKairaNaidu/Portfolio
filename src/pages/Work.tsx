As a part of the Technovation Challenge (an international entrepreneurship & app development challenge) I created an app called H2O: Healing Tomorrow's Oases, with my team (Sapna Shandilya, Muskan Rathi, Vrinda Sharma, Bhavya Gaur). It aimed at reducing plastic waste and water-borne diseases. With support from our friends (thanks Aaditya), teachers and mentors from Adobe, H2O won as the #1 app in all of Asia and got us scholarships!",
